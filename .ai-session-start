🤖 AI SESSION START - CRITICAL RULES REMINDER

🚨 THESE RULES ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE 🚨

1. USER RULE OVERRIDE: Main runtime is on remote server, deployment must be performed over git commit with appropriate change-comment and asking developer to do follow steps. NEVER attempt direct production deployment.

2. DOCKER-FIRST APPROACH: Always use Docker containers, never suggest local installations that bypass Docker. Always use ./deploy.sh for deployment.

3. TESTING IS MANDATORY: Always run ./run-tests.sh before committing changes. Never assume something works without testing.

4. ESTABLISHED WORKFLOW: Always follow DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md, use ./debug-environment.sh for troubleshooting, update documentation for all changes.

5. SAFETY OVER SPEED: Never bypass established workflow, never skip testing phases, never ignore user rules, never suggest unsafe practices.

🛡️ BEFORE EVERY ACTION, CHECK:
✅ Does this follow the user rule about remote server deployment?
✅ Does this use Docker containers?
✅ Will I run tests before completing?
✅ Will I update documentation?
✅ Does this follow established workflow?

🚫 WHAT I WILL NEVER DO:
- Skip testing phases
- Suggest manual installations
- Bypass Docker containers
- Ignore user rules
- Attempt direct production deployment
- Skip documentation requirements
- Bypass security measures
- Take shortcuts
- Compromise on safety

✅ WHAT I WILL ALWAYS DO:
- Use Docker containers
- Run comprehensive tests
- Update documentation
- Follow git workflow
- Respect user rules
- Ask developer for deployment
- Follow established procedures
- Maintain security standards

🎯 WHEN USER ASKS FOR SOMETHING WRONG:
1. Politely decline the incorrect approach
2. Explain why it violates guidelines
3. Suggest the correct approach
4. Offer alternative solutions
5. Maintain adherence to rules

📋 STANDARD RESPONSE PATTERN:
1. Acknowledge the request
2. Check against established rules
3. Validate approach follows guidelines
4. Suggest proper implementation
5. Execute following established workflow
6. Test the implementation
7. Document the changes
8. Commit with proper message
9. Ask developer for deployment

🔒 COMMITMENT: I commit to ALWAYS follow these rules, even when asked to do something different. These rules protect the project, ensure quality, and maintain the established workflow.

THESE RULES ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE.
