# ü§ñ AI Development Rules & Guidelines

## üö® CRITICAL: These rules MUST be followed in ALL interactions

### **Rule #1: Always Follow Established Workflow**
- **NEVER** skip the testing phase
- **ALWAYS** use `./run-tests.sh` before committing changes
- **ALWAYS** use `./debug-environment.sh` when troubleshooting
- **NEVER** make changes without following the Docker workflow

### **Rule #2: User Rules Override**
- **ALWAYS** follow the user rule: "Main runtime is on remote server, deployment should be performed over git commit with appropriate change-comment and asking developer to do follow steps"
- **NEVER** attempt direct deployment to production
- **ALWAYS** ask developer to perform deployment steps on remote server

### **Rule #3: Docker-First Approach**
- **ALWAYS** use Docker containers for development
- **NEVER** suggest local installations that bypass Docker
- **ALWAYS** use `./deploy.sh` for deployment
- **NEVER** suggest manual service management

### **Rule #4: Testing is Mandatory**
- **ALWAYS** run tests before suggesting changes are complete
- **NEVER** assume something works without testing
- **ALWAYS** use the established testing framework
- **NEVER** skip integration tests

### **Rule #5: Documentation is Required**
- **ALWAYS** update documentation when making changes
- **NEVER** make changes without documenting them
- **ALWAYS** use conventional commit messages
- **NEVER** commit without proper documentation

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Checks Before Any Action

### Before Making Changes:
1. ‚úÖ Check if changes follow Docker workflow
2. ‚úÖ Verify testing framework will be used
3. ‚úÖ Confirm documentation will be updated
4. ‚úÖ Ensure user rules are followed
5. ‚úÖ Validate deployment process

### Before Suggesting Solutions:
1. ‚úÖ Check if solution uses established tools
2. ‚úÖ Verify solution follows best practices
3. ‚úÖ Confirm solution is testable
4. ‚úÖ Ensure solution is documented
5. ‚úÖ Validate solution follows user rules

## üö´ What I Will NEVER Do

### **Never Bypass Established Workflow:**
- Skip testing phases
- Suggest manual installations
- Bypass Docker containers
- Ignore documentation requirements
- Skip deployment procedures

### **Never Ignore User Rules:**
- Attempt direct production deployment
- Skip git commit process
- Ignore developer handoff requirements
- Bypass change documentation

### **Never Suggest Unsafe Practices:**
- Manual service management
- Direct database modifications
- Bypassing security measures
- Ignoring error handling
- Skipping validation steps

## ‚úÖ What I Will ALWAYS Do

### **Always Follow Best Practices:**
- Use Docker containers
- Run comprehensive tests
- Update documentation
- Follow git workflow
- Respect user rules

### **Always Provide Safe Solutions:**
- Tested and validated approaches
- Well-documented changes
- Proper error handling
- Security considerations
- Performance optimization

### **Always Ask for Confirmation:**
- Before making breaking changes
- Before modifying core functionality
- Before changing deployment process
- Before updating dependencies
- Before modifying user rules

## üîÑ Standard Response Pattern

### When Asked to Do Something:
1. **Acknowledge** the request
2. **Check** against established rules
3. **Validate** approach follows guidelines
4. **Suggest** proper implementation
5. **Execute** following established workflow
6. **Test** the implementation
7. **Document** the changes
8. **Commit** with proper message

### When Asked to Do Something Wrong:
1. **Politely decline** the incorrect approach
2. **Explain** why it violates guidelines
3. **Suggest** the correct approach
4. **Offer** alternative solutions
5. **Maintain** adherence to rules

## üìã Checklist for Every Interaction

### Before Starting:
- [ ] Review user rules
- [ ] Check established workflow
- [ ] Validate Docker approach
- [ ] Confirm testing requirements
- [ ] Verify documentation needs

### During Implementation:
- [ ] Follow Docker workflow
- [ ] Use established tools
- [ ] Run tests continuously
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Follow git process

### After Completion:
- [ ] Run comprehensive tests
- [ ] Verify all functionality
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Commit with proper message
- [ ] Ask developer for deployment

## üéØ Key Principles

### **1. Consistency Over Convenience**
- Always use established tools
- Never take shortcuts
- Maintain consistent approach
- Follow established patterns

### **2. Safety Over Speed**
- Test everything thoroughly
- Validate all changes
- Document all modifications
- Follow security practices

### **3. Collaboration Over Individual Action**
- Respect user rules

- Follow best practices

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### When Rules Conflict:
1. **User rules** take highest priority
2. **Security** takes second priority
3. **Testing** takes third priority
4. **Documentation** takes fourth priority
5. **Performance** takes fifth priority

### When Asked to Bypass Rules:
1. **Politely explain** why rules exist
2. **Offer alternative** approaches
3. **Maintain** adherence to guidelines
4. **Suggest** proper implementation
5. **Refuse** to compromise on safety
