# User Management Panel Improvements - Changelog

## Overview
This update implements comprehensive improvements to the User Management panel in the Admin Dashboard, including UI optimization, backend functionality, and authentication fixes.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. User Management Panel Refactoring
- **Actions Column Repositioning**: Moved Actions column to be the first column for immediate access
- **Compact Column Design**: Optimized column widths for better space utilization
- **Compact Content Display**: 
  - Role badges show only first letter (A/D/R)
  - Status badges show "ON"/"OFF" instead of full words
  - Smaller text sizes and reduced padding

### 2. Backend User Management Endpoints
- **Password Reset Endpoint**: `PATCH /api/admin/users/{user_id}/password`
- **User Status Toggle**: `PATCH /api/admin/users/{user_id}/status`
- **Validation Email**: `POST /api/admin/users/{user_id}/send-validation`
- **Security Features**: Admin-only access, user validation, password hashing
- **Audit Logging**: All actions logged with proper metadata

### 3. Authentication Fixes
- **Token Storage Fix**: Fixed localStorage key mismatch between AuthContext and AdminDashboard
- **Admin Logout Prevention**: Resolved issue where admin was getting logged out during password reset
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages for 401/403/404 scenarios

### 4. Data Persistence Improvements
- **Enhanced Deploy Script**: Added MongoDB volume checks and automatic user recreation
- **User Recovery Script**: Created `create_test_users.sh` for quick user recreation
- **Data Preservation**: Improved Docker volume handling to prevent data loss

## 📁 Files Modified

- `backend/server.py`:
  - Added password reset endpoint with proper authentication
  - Added user status toggle endpoint
  - Added validation email endpoint
  - Fixed audit system parameter issues
  - Added proper error handling and logging

### Frontend Changes
- `frontend/src/components/AdminDashboard.js`:

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Endpoints
```python
# Password Reset
@api_router.patch("/admin/users/{user_id}/password")
async def admin_reset_user_password(user_id: str, request: Dict[str, str], current_user: User)

# Status Toggle
@api_router.patch("/admin/users/{user_id}/status") 
async def admin_toggle_user_status(user_id: str, request: Dict[str, bool], current_user: User)

# Send Validation
@api_router.post("/admin/users/{user_id}/send-validation")
async def admin_send_validation_email(user_id: str, current_user: User)
```

### Frontend Token Fix
```javascript
// Before (WRONG)
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');

// After (CORRECT)
const token = localStorage.getItem('mobility_token');
```

### UI Improvements
- **Actions Column**: Moved to first position for immediate access
- **Compact Design**: Reduced column widths by 15-25%
- **Badge Optimization**: Smaller, more efficient badges
- **Text Optimization**: Smaller font sizes for better space utilization
