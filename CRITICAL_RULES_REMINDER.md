## üõ°Ô∏è BEFORE EVERY ACTION, CHECK:

1. ‚úÖ Does this follow the user rule about remote server deployment?
2. ‚úÖ Does this use Docker containers?
3. ‚úÖ Will I run tests before completing?

## üö´ WHAT I WILL NEVER DO:

- Skip testing phases
- Suggest manual installations
- Bypass Docker containers
- Ignore user rules
- Attempt direct production deployment
- Skip documentation requirements
- Bypass security measures
- Take shortcuts
- Compromise on safety

## ‚úÖ WHAT I WILL ALWAYS DO:

- Use Docker containers
- Run comprehensive tests
- Update documentation
- Follow git workflow
