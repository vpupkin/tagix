# 🚀 Quick Fix Guide for Google Maps Issues

## ✅ Good News: Autocomplete is Working!

Your console shows `✅ Got autocomplete suggestions: 5` - this means the autocomplete is working perfectly!

## 🔧 Fix the Remaining Issues

### 1. "This page can't load Google Maps correctly" Error

This happens because your API key needs proper restrictions. Here's how to fix it:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Select your project**
3. **Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"**
4. **Click on your API key**
5. **Under "Application restrictions"**:
   - Select "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
   - Add these referrers:
     - `http://localhost:3000/*`
     - `http://localhost:8080/*`
     - `http://127.0.0.1:3000/*`
     - `http://127.0.0.1:8080/*`
6. **Click "Save"**

### 2. Rate Limiting (429 Error)

I've added debouncing to prevent too many API calls. The autocomplete will now wait 500ms after you stop typing before making a request.

### 3. Map ID Warning

I've added `mapId="DEMO_MAP_ID"` to fix the Advanced Markers warning.

## 🎯 What You Should See Now

After refreshing your browser:

1. **✅ Real Autocomplete**: Type "Stuttgart" and see actual addresses
2. **✅ Interactive Map**: Route preview with markers
3. **✅ Trip Information**: Estimated time and distance
4. **✅ Full Booking Flow**: Complete ride booking functionality

## 🧪 Test It

1. **Refresh your browser**
2. **Go to Book Ride page**
3. **Type in pickup location** (e.g., "Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof")
4. **You should see real Google Maps suggestions**
5. **Select a suggestion and see the map update**

## 📊 Console Should Show

- `✅ Got autocomplete suggestions: X` (where X is the number of suggestions)

The autocomplete is working! Just need to fix the API key restrictions. 🗺️✨
